# 1st-Assigment-CSFS1060-Scratch-Project



Welcome to the **Intergalactic Soccer Game**, where humans and dinosaurs share their soccer skills across galaxies.

As you embark on this short journey, you will have the opportunity to interact with one script featuring different sceneries. Let's dive in!

1st Scenery:
To start, press the "Space bar" on your keyboard, and a soccer field with a soccer player and a planet soccer ball will appear, slowly moving. The soccer player moves based on the mouse movement within a forever block, while Ben the soccer player has a thinking block that activates after 6 seconds of playing alone. When Ben touches the planet ball, it moves oppositely (180 degrees) and produces a "plop" sound.

Ben also has the power to score a goal by pressing the "D key" on your keyboard. When activated, the planet ball glides directly to Ben, and he can score with a "GOOL!" saying block for 2 seconds.

2nd Scenery:
After realizing that Ben needs a new mate to play soccer with, you can press the "F key" on your keyboard, changing the backdrop due to an "If condition block". Ben then flies to the Moon, accompanied by an alien sound to set the proper scenery.

Ben can still play, but a new command is set up with the "When S key pressed," activating a new script featuring a Dinosaur. Due to the lack of gravity, the Dinosaur moves randomly using the "Move 3" and "If on edge, bounce" blocks.

Ben can interact with the Dinosaur in the same way he interacts with the planet ball. When they touch, the "If" condition block allows them to talk, and each one says something. If Ben wants to convince the Dinosaur to play together, the "Control Broadcast block" sends a message when the "A key" is pressed. A delicious Taco food appears as a reward for the Dinosaur, who was hungry, and everyone moves to Earth with the dinosaur.

A "Stop control block" stops the game, and this is where the final scenery is about to start and end at the same time.

3rd and last Scenery:
In the final scene, Ben becomes a keeper, and the Dinosaur tries to score on Earth. When you press the "X key," all scripts move automatically due to a Control Broadcast that is defined for everyone. Make sure the Dinosaur scores to finish the game.

If you want to play again, press the space bar to start the game from the beginning. Enjoy the intergalactic soccer adventure!
